## Goal
This project stemmed from my nearly obsessive habit of checking prices of cryptocurrencies throughout the day on Coinranking. This led to me frequently forgetting about the coins I like or owned, and forced me to have multiple running lists of coins I was interested on different computers and other mediums. I decided to throw together a quick little Chrome Extension in order to add a 'favorites' functionality to the site for not only a consolidated list of coins but also an easy way to link to them without having to search for them on Coinranking.

## Usage
After adding this extension, go to [Coinranking](https://coinranking.com/) and you'll now see small 'favorite' stars on the left of each row / cryptocurrency. Click these to add that cryptocurrency to your list of favorites in the extension popup (the green + sign on the top right side of your browser, in the extensions toolbar). You can also do this on each cryptocurrencies specific page by the same 'favorite' star on the top of the page to the right of the current price.
